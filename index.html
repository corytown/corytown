                    <h1>How to Play</h1>
                    <p>To play, the player simply clicks the screen or presses any preferred key. Text will appear onscreen describing an event that takes part in the story. The player will face several challenges in which they will have to select the most reasonable and safest choice out of multiple options.

        <br><br>The <i>correct</i> answer: If the player successfully chooses the safest option for Cory, the game will cheerfully progress to the next scene.

        <br><br>The <i>incorrect</i> answer: If a wrong answer has been selected, the player will hear a dull sound and a thought bubble will appear, guiding the player to the correct answer and why to pick it.

        <br><br>If stuck, the player will have easy access to a paw print in the corner of the screen. This will provide the user with a small hint to help out the player.

        <br><br>Objective: The goal of the game is to clear all of the events including suspicious characters, peer pressure, and street knowledge. Once all correct answers have been chosen, the game will announce the achievement of the player and Cory will successfully enjoy his mango bubblegum chocolate-chip swirl ice cream.

        <br><br><i>Note: There is more than one way to clear the game!</i>

                    <h1>How Corytown Was Made</h1>

                  <p> The game was created for a targeted audience of 10 and under. With this in mind, the four creators started by storyboarding all of the routes on paper, planning dialogue, options, events, etc.
They then proceeded to flowchart the game out and watched several tutorial videos on how to use the program used to create the game: Fungus on Unity. Fungus is a software that makes it easy to generate stories through games using tons of code, animation, and art.
<br><br>The four members divided the work into each person’s specialties; the members worked generally in pairs in the areas they excelled in. For example, the visual and artistic area of the game consisted of two of the girls on Adobe Photoshop while they other two worked on writing the story’s dialogue and obstacles.
<br><br>At Pixar Animation Studios, the four team members learned the required computer science languages and basics and dove deeper to create Cory’s Crossroads: An adventure in safety and street smarts. Fungus was a major key role in the creation of this project as well as prior knowledge in Python, Scratch, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and C++.</p>
